# LandS Model

This repository contains the Landscape Succession Model (LandS), which simulates vegetation development based on Ecological Indicator Values (EIVs) and plant sociological concepts. 
Only an executable version of the model is provided here, along with two sample applications.

More information about the model can be found soon in Rumohr et al. (under review) or in publications of previous model versions Siehoff et al. [(2011)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.10.003) and Hudjetz et al. [(2014)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0113827).
